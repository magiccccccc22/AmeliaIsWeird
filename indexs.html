        My complaints with coding this:
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>actually, nothing<b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>this was a lot easier to code, now that i know the basics to coding a website</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        sorry this website was so much simpler, please give me other recommendations other then coding websites, i want more of a challenge
